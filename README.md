# Self-Projects
Repo for projects I work on for learning and out of self-interest.
If they're here it's usually cause they are small to medium sized projects that don't warrant their own repo. 

*Current Projects:
1. mnistGAN 
    A small exercise in building a GAN.
2. cifar100GAN
    I take the previous GAN model and try it on a slightly bigger dataset. With color.
