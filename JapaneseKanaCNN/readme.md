**Japanese Kana Classifier**

*Intro
This was a self defined CNN (i.e. built from scratch and doesn't use any machine learning or deep learning libraries) that I made a while back. My first ML project. Was done for academic purposes.
Utilizes datasets obtained from ETL database.

This project has a lot of work left to be honest. It was done as an exercise to build on my understanding of a convolutional neural net. The model works however training is a slog in its current iteration. A lot of optimization has to be implemented.

*How to Run
Mean to be run in colabs to be honest, unless you have all the relevant dependencies installed.

- Uses HiraganaR and KatakanaR npz files. Data is already preprocessed.
- Just run the script with the files uploaded. 
- npy files contains best weights achieved so far from a training session, these can just be uploaded and ran using the testing script.
